# Pratik Sinha's Academic Website

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my academic website! This website template is based on the GitHub Pages template for academic websites, originally created by Stuart Geiger, which is a fork of the Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme developed by Michael Rose. The theme is released under the MIT License.
